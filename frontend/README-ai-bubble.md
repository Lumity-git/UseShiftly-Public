# AI Assistant Bubble Component

This component provides a floating AI assistant for admin/manager users. It can be included on any page by:

1. Adding the following to your HTML:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="ai-bubble.css">
   <script src="ai-bubble.js"></script>
   ```
2. Ensure `auth-manager.js` is loaded before `ai-bubble.js`.
3. The bubble will only appear for users with ADMIN or MANAGER roles.

You can customize the backend integration in `ai-bubble.js`.
