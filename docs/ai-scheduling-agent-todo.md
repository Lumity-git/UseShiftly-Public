# TODO: AI Scheduling Agent for Hotel Employees

## Vision
Create an AI-powered agent to assist managers in scheduling employees based on:
- Employee availability
- Fair distribution of shifts within each department/building
- Compliance with business rules (max hours, rest periods, etc.)
- Employee preferences and constraints

## Features
- Integrate with existing employee/shift/department data
- Suggest optimal shift assignments for upcoming weeks
- Ensure fair rotation and coverage for all employees
- Handle special requests, time-off, and conflicts
- Provide managers with actionable recommendations and auto-scheduling options
- Support override and manual adjustments

## Technical Notes
- Use Spring Boot backend, integrate with current models and services
- Consider ML/optimization libraries (e.g., OptaPlanner, OR-Tools)
- Expose REST API endpoints for scheduling suggestions and actions
- UI dashboard for managers to review and approve schedules

## Next Steps
- Research scheduling algorithms and fairness metrics
- Design data model extensions for preferences/constraints
- Prototype agent logic and API endpoints
- Gather feedback from managers and employees
