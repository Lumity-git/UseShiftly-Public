- Implement mobile-optimized UI/UX for shift management, notifications, and profile management.
- Push notification support for shift changes, approvals, and urgent alerts.
- Secure mobile login and session management.
- App Store deployment and ongoing support.

**Technical Considerations:**
- Evaluate React Native, Flutter, or native Swift for iOS development.
- Ensure API compatibility and versioning for mobile clients.
- Mobile-specific error handling and offline support.

## Phase 3: Complex Payroll System

**Objective:**
Automate payroll calculations and reporting, integrating with shift data and supporting various pay structures.

**Key Features:**
